Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the stock prices for four major technology companies: Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, and Google (collectively referred to as "MANG"). This analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook using various Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas, to gain valuable insights into these stocks over a specified time period.

In the course of my analysis, I accomplished several key tasks:

Data Collection: I collected historical stock price data for Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, and Google, ensuring that we had a substantial dataset for analysis.

Data Visualization: I leveraged the power of Python's data visualization libraries to create histograms and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots. These visualizations provided a clear and intuitive representation of the distribution of stock prices and their patterns over time.

Correlation Analysis: By utilizing Pandas, I conducted correlation analysis to identify relationships between these stocks. This analysis allowed us to understand how changes in one stock may be associated with changes in another, which is crucial for diversifying investment portfolios.

Predictive Modeling: I used various Python libraries to predict the closing prices of the MANG companies. This predictive modeling can provide valuable insights for investors and traders, aiding them in making informed decisions.

Moving Average Calculations: To analyze trends and smooth out price fluctuations, I computed moving averages for different time intervals. This technique is essential for identifying potential buy and sell signals.

Risk Assessment: I also quantified the level of risk associated with investing in these stocks. Understanding the risk involved is a fundamental aspect of investment decision-making.

In summary, I conducted an in-depth analysis of MANG stock prices, employing Python libraries to visualize data, establish correlations, predict future prices, calculate moving averages, and assess risk. This analytical approach is invaluable for anyone looking to make informed investment choices in the dynamic world of stock trading.
