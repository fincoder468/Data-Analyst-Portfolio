# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
**_Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!_**

## About
Hi, I'm Poonam! I have an engineering background and hold a Bachelor of Technology degree in Civil from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee(IIT Roorkee).
I am a data enthusiast with a strong interest and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data in some projects and also developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends in supply chain management. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new datasets and find insights with tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
